# Project Proposal

## Objective
Propose a full-stack web application you want to build by the end of the semester.

## Submission
**Due date: Tuesday, September 12 @ 11:59PM EST.**

**Submit via BlackBoard.**

## Criteria
Modern full stack applications (think Facebook/Gmail) are pretty complex and deliver many features and services, but they typically start as much smaller efforts.

For your project proposals, come up with ideas roughly fitting into one of the following four platform categories of full-stack applications. (These are not the only categories for applications, just the most common. Many businesses and applications have features that cross multiple categories.)

**No worries if your idea does not fit any of the shared categories. Please propose your idea regardless. The categories are maintly a starting point.**

1. **Communication Platforms**: These are among the hardest to build. They allow users to sign up and share usernames to communicate via direct or group messages in real-time like text messaging or calling (voice and video).

    Examples:
      - Google Meet
      - Slack
      - WhatsApp

2. **Marketplace or Exchange Platforms**: This category makes physical or digital goods (including services) available for sale or trade. Either from a central seller that maintains an inventory or allows users to post the inventory.

    Examples:
      - Amazon
      - eBay
      - Etsy

3. **Social Media Platforms**: Allow users to create "friend" networks and share content (text, image, and video) in a public or semi-private way.

    Examples:
      - Facebook
      - Instagram
      - LinkedIn
      - Snapchat
      - Twitter

4. **Content Creation & Distribution Platforms**: These are the core platforms for news and blog sites. They allow a limited group of content creator users to create and edit the content they later distribute.

    Examples:
      - Google Suite (Docs, Sheets, Slides)
      - Medium
      - Netflix
      - Photoshop (Online)
      - Youtube

## Requirements
- A PDF document (<2 pages) covering the following:
  - What does the application do?
  - What is the motivation for the application?
  - Who would use the application?
  - Is there a need or want in the market it fulfills?
  - What technologies do you plan on using?
  - Are there similar applications or competitors available now? 
    - How does your idea differ? 
    - Why is there a need for a competitor?
  - Which Public API do you intend to use?
    - Your project must utilize a Public API.
      - Examples of Public APIs:
        - [Etsy](https://developers.etsy.com/documentation/)
        - [Genius](https://docs.genius.com/)
        - [SkyScanner](https://skyscanner.github.io/slate/#api-documentation)
        - [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api)
